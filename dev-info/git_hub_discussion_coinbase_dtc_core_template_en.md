## Discussion Body — Copy & Paste

**👋 Welcome to the Coinbase DTC Core Discussions!**

We’re using Discussions as a central place to connect with the community: ask questions, share ideas, get help, and collaborate on the project. Please use the appropriate category (see below) to keep everything organized.

### Introduce Yourself
Write one sentence about who you are and what you want to do with the project (e.g., “I’m using this to feed Coinbase market data into Sierra Chart”).

### What Discussions Are For
- Questions about usage or installation
- Feature suggestions and architecture ideas
- Development help (code, integration, testing)
- Discussions about design decisions and roadmap

### Helpful Guidelines
- Before posting, check if a similar discussion already exists.
- For issues or errors: include logs, versions (OS, compiler, library), and a short description of what you tried.
- For feature requests: describe your use case, expected outcome, and optionally a priority level (P0–P3).

## For Maintainers / Moderators (Quick Guide)
- Create categories: **Announcements**, **Questions**, **Ideas & Feature Requests**, **Help & Tutorials**, **Developer Talk**.
- Pin a “Read First” discussion summarizing the project and current sprint focus.
- Link related issue templates (e.g., `bug`, `feature request`) in the moderation info.

## Example First Comment (for new users)
**Hi everyone — I’m [Name].** I’d like to download historical candle data from Coinbase and store it locally. I already have my API keys but I’m struggling with rate limits. Which HTTP/retry library are you using, and how do you handle pagination for long time ranges?
