## Discussion Body — Copy & Paste

**👋 Welcome to the Coinbase DTC Core Discussions!**

**🚀 Current Status**: JWT authentication is working! We have API connectivity and Docker deployment ready. The core DTC protocol integration is the next major milestone.

We're using Discussions as a central place to connect with the community: ask questions, share ideas, get help, and collaborate on the project. Please use the appropriate category (see below) to keep everything organized.

### What's Working Now
- ✅ Coinbase API connectivity (all public endpoints)
- ✅ JWT authentication (ES256/ECDSA for Advanced Trade API)
- ✅ Cross-platform builds (Windows MSVC + Linux GCC)
- ✅ Docker containerization (multi-stage builds)
- ✅ Credential management (multiple formats)

### What We're Building Next
- ❌ DTC protocol message structures
- ❌ Real-time WebSocket market data feeds
- ❌ Coinbase → DTC message translation
- ❌ DTC server implementation

### Introduce Yourself
Write one sentence about who you are and what you want to do with the project (e.g., "I'm using this to feed Coinbase market data into Sierra Chart via DTC protocol").

### What Discussions Are For
- Questions about usage or installation
- Feature suggestions and architecture ideas
- Development help (code, integration, testing)
- Discussions about design decisions and roadmap

### Helpful Guidelines
- Before posting, check if a similar discussion already exists.
- For issues or errors: include logs, versions (OS, compiler, library), and a short description of what you tried.
- For feature requests: describe your use case, expected outcome, and optionally a priority level (P0–P3).

## For Maintainers / Moderators (Quick Guide)
- Create categories: **Announcements**, **Questions**, **Ideas & Feature Requests**, **Help & Tutorials**, **Developer Talk**.
- Pin a “Read First” discussion summarizing the project and current sprint focus.
- Link related issue templates (e.g., `bug`, `feature request`) in the moderation info.

## Example First Comment (for new users)
**Hi everyone — I’m [Name].** I’d like to download historical candle data from Coinbase and store it locally. I already have my API keys but I’m struggling with rate limits. Which HTTP/retry library are you using, and how do you handle pagination for long time ranges?
