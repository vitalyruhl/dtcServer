### Current Priority Tasks

#### 🚧 NEXT - GUI Account Info Implementation (Tomorrow)
- **Issue**: GUI client successfully connects and shows login success, but missing actual account data display
- **Problem**: DTC protocol missing `AccountBalancesRequest`, `AccountBalanceUpdate` message types  
- **Available**: Only `CURRENT_POSITIONS_REQUEST` (400) and `POSITION_UPDATE` (401) in protocol.hpp
- **Solution Options**:
  1. Use available `CurrentPositionsRequest` and adapt for account data
  2. Add missing account balance message types to DTC protocol
- **Goal**: Complete account info panel showing balance, positions, portfolio in GUI red box area

#### 🚧 NEXT - DTC Protocol Account Messages  
- **Need**: Add `AccountBalancesRequest`, `AccountBalanceUpdate` message types
- **Reference**: Check DTC specification for complete account message set
- **Status**: Protocol currently has limited account operations

#### 🚧 NEXT - Test Account Info Workflow
- **Flow**: Login → Request Balance → Request Positions → Display in Account Panel
- **Verify**: [MOCKED DATA] labeling consistency and split-screen layout
- **Current**: Login works, missing account data requests

#### 🚧 FUTURE - Server-side Coinbase Integration
- **Goal**: Replace mocked data with real Coinbase API calls in DTC server
- **Priority**: After GUI account display is working

### ✅ WORKING (REAL):
- **DTC Protocol**: Full bidirectional communication between client and server ✅
- **TCP Sockets**: Multi-threaded server handling multiple clients ✅  
- **Message Flow**: LogonRequest → LogonResponse → MarketDataRequest working ✅
- **Test Clients**: Multiple test clients connecting and receiving DTC messages ✅
- **Server Capabilities**: Server correctly reports capabilities and streams data ✅
- **Coinbase WebSocket**: SSL connection with JWT auth working ✅
- **Live Market Data**: Real-time streaming from Coinbase (BTC ~$95,950, ETH ~$3,185) ✅
- **SSL/TLS**: Complete WebSocket SSL implementation with certificate validation ✅

### ⚙️ CONFIGURED (Working but from config):
- **Symbol List**: BTC-USD, ETH-USD, SOL-USD from server config
- **Server Capabilities**: Trading/Market Data support flags
- **Server Name**: "CoinbaseDTCServer" from configuration

### 🚧 CURRENT ISSUE - Client Data Flow:
- **Data Bridge**: Server receives live Coinbase data but clients show mock data
- **TCP Connection**: Established but server doesn't log client connections
- **DTC Message Flow**: Server broadcasts live data but clients use internal mock responses
- **Root Cause**: Client-server DTC protocol communication not properly bridged

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES
